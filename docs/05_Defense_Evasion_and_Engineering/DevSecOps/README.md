# DevSecOps Overview

## What is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps is an extension of the DevOps methodology that integrates security practices into the DevOps process. The goal of DevSecOps is to ensure that security is a fundamental aspect of the development lifecycle, from design through deployment and maintenance. This approach emphasizes the need to incorporate security measures throughout the development process, rather than treating security as a separate or final step.

## Most Common Terms

- **DevOps**: A practice that combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to enhance collaboration and productivity by automating infrastructure, workflows, and continuously measuring application performance.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: A practice where code changes are automatically tested and merged into a shared repository frequently.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: The practice of automating the release of applications to production environments, ensuring that code changes can be released reliably and quickly.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable scripts rather than manual processes.
- **Security as Code**: Integrating security practices directly into the CI/CD pipeline and development processes.
- **Vulnerability Management**: The process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating security vulnerabilities within software and systems.

## Tools Used in DevSecOps

### Security Scanning Tools

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Tools like [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/), [Checkmarx](https://www.checkmarx.com/), and [Fortify](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/cyberres/application-security/fortify) that analyze source code for vulnerabilities without executing the program.
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Tools such as [OWASP ZAP](https://owasp.org/www-project-zap/), [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp), and [Netsparker](https://www.netsparker.com/) that analyze running applications for vulnerabilities.

### **SCA (Software Composition Analysis) vs. SSC (Static Security Code Analysis)**  

| **Feature**  | **SCA (Software Composition Analysis)** | **SSC (Static Security Code Analysis)** |
|-------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Focus** | Analyzes **third-party dependencies & open-source libraries** for vulnerabilities. | Scans **custom source code** for security vulnerabilities. |
| **Scope** | Identifies risks in **external libraries & frameworks** (e.g., NPM, PyPI, Maven). | Detects security flaws in **proprietary application code**. |
| **Detection** | Finds **known vulnerabilities (CVEs)** in open-source components. | Finds **code-level security issues** like SQL Injection, XSS, RCE, etc. |
| **Method** | Uses vulnerability databases (NVD, OSS Index, Snyk, etc.) to match dependencies. | Uses **static code analysis** (pattern matching, data flow analysis). |
| **Examples of Tools** | 🔹 **Snyk** <br> 🔹 **WhiteSource** <br> 🔹 **BlackDuck** <br> 🔹 **OWASP Dependency-Check** | 🔹 **SonarQube** <br> 🔹 **Checkmarx** <br> 🔹 **Veracode** <br> 🔹 **Semgrep** |
| **False Positives** | Low (matches against known vulnerability databases). | Higher (requires tuning & rule customization). |
| **DevSecOps Integration** | Works at **build-time**, inside CI/CD pipelines. | Used **during development** & **CI/CD** for early detection. |
| **Remediation** | Suggests **dependency updates** or patches. | Requires **code changes & fixes by developers**. |
| **Performance Impact** | Fast (scans dependency lists, not full code). | Slower (deep scans of the entire codebase). |

### **Key Differences:**
- **SCA = Focuses on dependencies** (external libraries).  
- **SSC = Focuses on the source code** (proprietary code security).  

### **Which One Should Use?**  
✅ **For Open-Source & Third-Party Dependency Risks → SCA**  
✅ **For Custom Application Code Vulnerabilities → SSC**  
✅ **For Full Security Coverage → Use Both** in your DevSecOps pipeline! 🚀
